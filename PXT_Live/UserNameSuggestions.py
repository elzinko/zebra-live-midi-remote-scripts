# ***************************** [SETTINGS NOTES] **************************

# It is recommended that you back this file up BEFORE modifying it. 

# Please DO NOT change any of the spacing in this file. 
 
# Please DO NOT change the name of this file or its file extension.  When done 
# making your changes to the settings below, just save the file.
 
# After saving this file, you will need to close/restart Live for your changes 
# to take effect.


# ***************************** [SETTINGS DESCRIPTION] **************************

# The SUGGESTIONS list below, is the list of terms that will be used as suggestions
# in Rename Mode.

# You can remove or add entries as you see fit.  For example, if you never use one
# or more of the terms in the list, you should remove the term(s).  Or, if you are repeatedly
# using a term that is not listed, you should add the term.


# ***************************** [REMOVING TERMS] **************************

# Removing a term is as simple as deleting the term as well as the comma that follows it.
# However, if you'd like to remove the last term in the list (which does not have a comma 
# following it), you will need to remove the comma from the previous term.  In other words, 
# the list has to end with a term that does NOT have a comma following it.  


# ***************************** [ADDING TERMS] **************************

# When adding a term in the list, please note the following:

# * Terms can be no longer than 16 characters.
# * Terms cannot contain single quotes/apostrophes or backslashes.
# * Terms should be enclosed in single quotes.
# * Terms, except for the last term, should be followed by a comma.

# * The capitalization you use when entering terms does not matter.
# * You do not need to add terms in alphabetical order (PXT-Live will sort them for you).
