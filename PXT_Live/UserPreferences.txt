***************************** [ACCESSORY MODE SETTINGS] **************************

# The following settings determine the function of the Track Selection and Track State
# Buttons as well as the Display in Accessory Mode.

# For each Button below, you can specify either:
# - None, which will cause the Button and associated Display section to have no function.

# - A list of settings composed of the following:
#	Name, Color, Press Action List, Release Action List

#   Or, if you're using ClyphX Pro, the list should look like this (notice the use of the colon!):
#   Name, Color, Press Action List : Release Action List


#	SETTINGS DESCRIPTIONS:
#	Name - 	Specifies the text to show in the Display for the Button. This should 
#		typically be a hint describing the function of the Button.  Only 8 
#		characters (including space and punctuation) can be displayed per Button.
#		Also, commas cannot be used.

#	Color - Specifies the LED color the Button should use.  This can be either 
#		Red, Amber, Yellow or Green.

#	Press Action List - Specifies the ClyphX Action List to perform when the Button
#				is pressed.

#	Release Action List (optional) - Specifies the ClyphX Action List to perform 
#					when the Button is released.


# 	SETTINGS EXAMPLES:
#	TRACK_SELECT_1 = Loop 1/2, Green, Clip Loop *0.5 ; Clip Loop Show
#	TRACK_SELECT_2 = Loop Dbl, Yellow, Clip Loop *2 ; Clip Loop Show
#	TRACK_SELECT_3 = Reset, Red, All/Vol Reset ; All/Pan Reset , 1/Sel 1

***************************** [SETTINGS PATH] **************************

# In most cases, this setting should NOT be changed. It is only useful in cases
# where your settings are not being stored/recalled properly, which would typically 
# be due to a permissions issue. In those cases, you can specify an alternate 
# file path to use for storing/recalling your settings.

# For example: C:\Users\Stray\Documents

SETTINGS_PATH = None


***************************** [ACCESSORY MODE VARIABLES] **************************

# This section allows you to define a special type of variable that you can use in
# your ACCESSORY MODE settings above.  The variables you define here are special
# because their values can be edited via the Encoder Rename Mode.  This allows 
# for much more flexibility in your Action Lists.

# For example, you could define a variable here like this:
# BPM = 100

# Then use it in one (or more) of the Accessory Mode Settings above like this:
# TRACK_STATE_1 = BPM Ramp, Green, BPM Ramp 4 #BPM#

# By default, this variable (BPM) will have the value you specified (100).  You can 
# change this in Rename Mode by holding down Shift and tapping Encoder 1 or 2 until you 
# reach the X-Control type.  Now you can change the value of this variable from 100 to 
# anything you like using Rename Mode.  If you've defined more than one variable
# you can navigate between the variables by using Encoder 1 or 2 in Rename Mode.  

# You can define as many variables as you like here and use them in any way you like in 
# your Action Lists.  There are just a few things to be aware of:

# - Variable names have to be a single word (like BPM or ramp_length), should only contain
#   letters, numbers and underscores and should be less than 17 characters long.   

# - Each variable should be defined on its own line and has to be of the form:
#   variable_name = variable_value

# - When using a variable in an Action List, the variable needs to be enclosed in hash
#   tags (like #BPM#). Also, if multiple successive variables are used in an Action
#   List, they should be separated by space (like #ramp_length# #BPM#). 

# Create your list of variables starting below this line.
