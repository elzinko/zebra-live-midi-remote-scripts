***************************** [DRUM MODE SETTINGS] **************************

# The following settings determine the LED colors to use for Pads in Drum Mode.

# For all of these settings, the names of the usable LED colors are:

    # OFF 
    # WHITE_DIM, WHITE_HALF, WHITE_FULL
    # RED_DIM, RED_HALF, RED_FULL
    # AMBER_DIM, AMBER_HALF, AMBER_FULL
    # YELLOW_DIM, YELLOW_HALF, YELLOW_FULL
    # GREEN_DIM, GREEN_HALF
    # BLUE_DIM, BLUE_HALF, BLUE_FULL
    # PURPLE_DIM, PURPLE_HALF, PURPLE_FULL


# This setting determines the LED color to use for Pads controlling Drum Rack pads that aren't empty.
PAD_NOT_EMPTY = YELLOW_FULL

# This setting determines the LED color to use for Pads controlling Drum Rack pads that are empty.
PAD_EMPTY = YELLOW_HALF

# This setting determines the LED color to use for Pads controlling Drum Rack pads that are muted.
PAD_MUTED = AMBER_HALF

# This setting determines the LED color to use for Pads controlling Drum Rack pads that are soloed.
PAD_SOLOED = BLUE_HALF

# This setting determines the LED color to use for Pads controlling Drum Rack pads that are selected.
PAD_SELECTED = BLUE_FULL

# This setting determines the LED color to use for Pads controlling Drum Rack pads that are empty and selected.
PAD_EMPTY_SELECTED = BLUE_DIM

# This setting determines the LED color to use for Pads controlling Impulse pads.
PAD_IMPULSE = PURPLE_FULL


# Below you can define associations between LED colors and Drum Rack pad names (or portions of pad names).

# For example, you could associate RED_FULL with any Drum Rack pad that contains the word Kick in its name.
# That would look like this:
# PAD_COLOR_TO_NAME = RED_FULL, Kick

# You can associate a single LED color with multiple names/variations of names as well.
# For example, you may want to associate PURPLE_FULL with snares, but snares in various
# kits may not use the word Snare in their name, they might use Snr instead.  You can
# accommodate that like so:
# PAD_COLOR_TO_NAME = PURPLE_FULL, Snare, Snr  

# Note that the pad names you specify here are NOT cases-sensitive.  Also, the associations 
# you create here will override the PAD_NOT_EMPTY setting above.

# Create your associations below.  Put each association on its own line.  Each line should start
# with PAD_COLOR_TO_NAME and use the format shown in the examples above.
